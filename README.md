# cli_calculator
A CLI calculator that parses and solves arithmetic expressions while respecting order of operations.

This is mostly a project initially intended for learning how to do basic arithmetic expression parsing.
Once I feel happy with the python implementation, I intend to port it to other languages that I want to learn.

Possible future implementations may be in C, C++, Rust, Scala, maybe Go.
